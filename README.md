## Features Implemented and Values learned:

- Dhairy Raval
	* Implemented UserStory #4, adding the ability to see all the tweets of the people you follow. 	
	(Credits to Arjun for helping me, implement a way to display the full tweet when the user clicks on it) 

- Arjun Banga
   * Implemented User Story #7, displaying a list of users that follow you. The list is displayed on the right sidebar.
   * Implemented User Story #6, letting an administrator access the adminstrator interface that allows them to create new accounts with either microblog author or admin roles.
   * Implemented User Story #11, creating a basic tweet share functionality that works similar to retweet. Pressing the share button once makes a user share the tweet and twice makes them unshare.


- Miftahul Kashfy
   * Implemented User Story #5, searching tweets based on person's name or twitter handle
   * Implemented User Story #8, posting a tweet and showing appropriate message for it

   * What I learned: This assignment seemed more fun to me. Making the JediTweeps applications helped me realize how what I am
   					 learning now can one day be implemented in real life practices. 

- Ishan Bhatia (B00835259)
   * Implemented the user story #1, allowing the user to login to the website and incteract with different actions (Credits to Dhairy for assisting in regenerating the session id)
   * Implemented the user story #3, allowing the user to logout from the website to prevent unauthorized access. 
   * Implemented the front-end layout for the login page and the main website.
   * What I learned: This assignment allowed me to use my theoritical knowledge to create a basic website which could potentially have real world applications. It gave me an idea of how social media platforms operate on a basic level and what steps they take to protect the user data by following proper security guidelines. It also helped me to get a hands on experience of working with a development team.
